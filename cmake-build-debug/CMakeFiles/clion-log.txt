CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

--     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   -- full optimizations
--     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug     -- better debugging experience in gdb
--     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelASan   -- full optimizations plus address and undefined-behavior sanitizers
--     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DebugASan -- debug plus sanitizers
